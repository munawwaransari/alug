There are three basic diacritics for vowel sounds corresponding to English vowels (u, a, i). They are called dhamma, fataha and kasara respectively. The 3 long vowels Wao, Alif and Ya also represent these three sounds. The other diacritics are: sukoon (shaped as a tiny circle) is used to indicate a glottal stop.. shadda marker is used for double consonant sounds..and madd is used to elongate a vowel sound."

These are called Erabs and are generally used on the last letter of a word (in case of a noun).. the Erabs help in identifying case of a noun or mood of a verb. When the diacritics are used as Erab, they are termed with different states called  Rafa, Nasab, Jarr or Jazm. The Nunnation markers (called Tanween) are also Erab markers which are formed by using the Dhamma, Fataha and Kasarah markers wit a Noon consonant. The Noon letter (called Noon-e-Erabi) is not written and the diacric markers are written twice for (tanween). Example tanween sounds are: unn, ann, inn"

The alphabets can be divided into two halves...one called Hoorrofu Shamsi (Solar Letters) and other half is called Lunar letters (Hooruful Qamari). When Solar letters have Laam Tareef, the Letter Laam is silent and not read; instead the solar letter is read with a shadda marker as in word Ashshams (letter laam is not read).
